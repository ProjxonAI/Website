  ## Principles we lean on
  1. **Quiet hierarchy** — We keep typography intentional and let gradients do the heavy lifting.
  2. **Soft motion** — Animations signal context changes, never urgency.
  3. **Purposeful contrast** — Dark shells with focused accents mirror our local-first mindset.

  ## Collaboration loops
  Every week we run crit with engineering and research at the same table. It keeps decisions aligned
  and prevents the "handoff" gaps that often derail early teams.
