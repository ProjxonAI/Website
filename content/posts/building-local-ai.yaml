  ## Why local matters
  The closer intelligence lives to the person using it, the less it has to borrow context
  or leak information. We start every prototype by asking _what needs to stay on device_,
  not _what can we cache in the cloud_.

  - Local-first keeps latency down.
  - Local-first makes trust tangible.
  - Local-first encourages better product decisions.

  ## Craft over hype
  We're intentionally shipping small surfaces first. That means tight instrumentation,
  lots of manual onboarding, and an obsessive focus on how calm the product feels day to day.

  ## What's next
  We'll continue sharing in-progress notes here. If you're curious about the beta,
  email [support@projxon.ai](mailto:support@projxon.ai) and tell us a bit about your work.
